# Python_code
## First project
collatz.py is one of my first projects. I decided to put it here as some kind of maths fun fact. <br />
This is the case where you can choose any positive int and transform it to one only using two operations. <br />

## pageviews_analysis
pageviews_analysis is a little more complicated code. I analyzed there some primary pageviews data. I didn't use any additional library for this project, but I managed to count visits, find the most active user and some more information you can find in summary at the bottom of the file.
